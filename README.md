Node-sass wrapped to work with meteor.

This allows .scss and .sass files to work with meteor.

Also includes the option to run [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) on the css that sass has compiled.

To use:
This package is configured to find *.scss *.sass files and compile them through node-sass and provide them to the page. So just start using it, the scss files can be anywhere in the project.

Configuration
-------------

Add a `scss.json` file at the project's root to pass configuration options to node-sass. See [node-sass](https://github.com/sass/node-sass)'s documentation for a list of options.

Example (for using bourbon and neat with meteor-bower):

```json
{
  "includePaths": [
    ".meteor/local/bower",
    ".meteor/local/bower/node-bourbon/assets/stylesheets",
    ".meteor/local/bower/neat/app/assets/stylesheets"
  ]
}
```

Autoprefixer support
--------------------
To enable Autoprefixer support, set 'enableAutoprefixer' to true in your 'scss.json' file. Custom [Autoprefixer config](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer-core#usage) can be set in the 'autoprefixerOptions' variable in the same file. If you don't specify any options, the [default](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer-core#usage) config will be used.

Autoprefixer example:

```json
{
  "enableAutoprefixer": true,
  "autoprefixerOptions": {
      "browsers": ["> 5%", "BlackBerry", "OperaMini"],
      "cascade": false
  }
}
```

LibSass vs Ruby Sass
--------------------
Please note that this project uses LibSass. As such some features are not implemented compared to the Ruby version/implementation. Things are improving, so please be patient. Before you ask, I have no intention of making a version of this package that links to the Ruby version instead.


Heroku
------
If you're having problems running this on Heroku please use the cedar-14 stack, by typing the following `heroku stack:set cedar-14` - see [#41](https://github.com/fourseven/meteor-scss/issues/41) for more information.
